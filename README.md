# lowpolyDA40NG
An attempt to create a low poly (lightweight) model of DA40NG for Multiplayer for use in a FlightGear flight simulator

Work in progress...

Current design guidelines / ideas:
- low polygon count
- small textures
- no interior model (assume model is viewed from a far distance), so cockpit windows are only painted on a texture
- minimal animations:
  - propeller
  - major flight control surfaces
  - essential lights
- Blender 3.6.19
